There are two functions for adding and removing entries.

def addEntry(workbklist, category, amount, note, wallet, currency, date)
Arguments:
- workbklist: the mlRow list to add to
- category: string for category that transaction falls under
- amount: integer or floating point number indicating amount of transaction, note that wallet debits are negative numbers and wallet credits are positive numbers
- note: string for note about transaction
- wallet: string for wallet that transaction came from
- currency: string for currency used
- date: a datetime object or string representation in mm/dd/yyyy format

This function takes the arguments, creates a new mlRow object and appends it to the mlRow list.  It then returns the modified list.
Note that this function both returns the list and the original list is modified, e.g. if you pass the return value to a variable
you will have two copies of the same list.  The function assigns entry IDs on its own to avoid duplicates.

def removeEntry(workbklist, obj)
Arguments:
- workbklist: the mlRow list to remove from
- obj: the mlRow object that you want to remove from the list

This function takes the arguments and removes the object obj from the list workbklist.  It then returns the modified list.
Note like above, the original list will be modified AND that modified list will be returned.

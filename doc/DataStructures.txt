The driving structure behind the MoneyLover-Excel-Lib engine is the mlRow class
and lists of said class.  The mlRow class represents each row entry (transaction) 
in the MoneyLover spreadsheet.

mlRow class contains the following variables:

id - int for unique transaction id
category - string for category name
amount - float for amount of transaction
note - string for note attached to transaction
wallet - string for what wallet transaction came from
currency - string for currency transaction was in
date - this is a datetime object for the date of the transaction, except in
	the header, then it is a string

And the following methods:

display()
The class contains a display() method to display a nicely formatted print
out of the transaction.  No arguments provided.

__init__(self, wbRow)
The constructor takes an argument of an array in the format
[id, category, amount, note, wallet, currency, date]
All variables are assigned directly with no processing.

compare(self, row)
Takes an argument of another mlRow class.  Returns True if all data contained
is the same, returns False if not.

Every spreadsheet generated by MoneyLover also contains a first row that tells
what each column is at the top of the file.  When we load the excel document,
we separate the header and provide it as a single mlRow class.  Every variable
in the header mlRow object is a string.  It must be kept or generated to write
to a file.

IN ADDITION

There is a function to convert between an mlRow class list and a double indexed
array.  This is used internally for writing out to files.

generateArray(rowClassList)

Arguments:
- rowClassList: an mlRow class list

Returns a double indexed array representing the mlRow list

The driving structure behind the MoneyLover-Excel-Lib engine is the mlRow class
and lists of said class.  The mlRow class represents each row entry (transaction) 
in the MoneyLover spreadsheet.

mlRow class contains the following variables:
id - int for unique transaction id
category - string for category name
amount - float for amount of transaction
note - string for note attached to transaction
wallet - string for what wallet transaction came from
currency - string for currency transaction was in
date - this is a datetime object for the date of the transaction, except in
	the header, then it is a string

The class also contains a display() method to display a nicely formatted print
out of the transaction.  No arguments provided.

Every spreadsheet generated by MoneyLover also contains a first row that tells
what each row is at the top of the file.  When we load the excel document,
we separate the header and provide it as a single mlRow class.  Every variable
in the header mlRow object is a string.  It must be kept or generated to write
to a file.

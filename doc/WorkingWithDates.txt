Internally, dates are represented as datetime objects for easier manipulation.
The function interfaces, however, deal with strings in mm/dd/yyyy format.

The functions to work with dates are as follows:

spliceDateRange(startdate, enddate, workbklist)

This function returns a list of mlRow objects sorted by date and ranging from
startdate to enddate, taken from workbklist.  startdate and enddate are date
strings in mm/dd/yyyy format.  workbklist is a list of mlRow objects.  The 
bounding dates need not be within the date range of the list.  Upon error, the
function returns -1.

sortByDate(workbklist)

This function takes an mlRow list as an argument and returns the list sorted
by date.

dateSearchAll(date, sortedlist)

This function takes arguments of a date string in format mm/dd/yyyy and a date
sorted list.  It returns the indexes of all instances of the given date in the 
list in a list format.  It returns -1 upon error.

dateSearch(date, sortedlist)

This function takes an argument of a datetime object date and a date sorted 
list sortedlist.  It does a binary search of sortedlist and returns the first
instance of date found in the list.  It is designed to be an internal function
and its use is highly discouraged.  dateSearchAll() is recommended to be used.
